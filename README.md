# Binary Classification of Diabates Dataset using Machine Learning
This is an interactive web application using Streamlit and Python to plot and demonstrate evaluation metrics for binary classification algorithms of the diabetes dataset obtained from Kaggle. This allows users to choose what classification algorithm and hyperparameters they want to use. The models are trained with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifiers using scikit-learn.
